# My Portfolio
Recently refactored my portfolio to a full stack application. I'm using Vue/GQL on the front end and node/GQL/MongoDB on the back end. The main change is an admin interface for me to add/delete projects easily. **Currently in the process of refactoring the front end to use react, related files can be found in ```react-refactor/```**
